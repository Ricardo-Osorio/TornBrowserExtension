Bugs:
    - The sidebar is currently being added multiple times whenever the script is loaded (at the moment it's only on manual reload but this should be fixed if it's easy)

Features:
    - Menu somewhere that stays over other elements in the page with options:
        - Link to previous bazaar opened (making the process of going back and forward easier if we don't currently have the money to buy all the under prices items)
        - Able to hide the sidebar and how on hover maybe?
    - Clicking the buy from the market page will open a list of bazaar/people. This could have some sort of highlight to help find the one that is cheapest
    - Add a blacklist bazaar list that somehow highlights them with a red cross or lock and prevents me from losing time with those
    - Items that are selling for the same price as they sell are good to store money (without risking being mugged) so those could use an icon to easily spot them (a chest?)
    - A visual hint when there's not enough money to buy something, both on the market and bazaar
    - Able to define a desired profit point at which it will highlight items differently, for example Profit > $1000
    - Show the total amount of money that can be made if the person were to buy/sell all items in a page. Show this on the top bar next to the "search" input field. That way, on pages that are long to scroll down it's easier to spot this.
